                <div><p>Properly cutting off multi-line text is a surprisingly hard thing to do
well.</p><span>
</span><ul>
<li><code>overflow: hidden</code>&nbsp;provides no indication of the text cut off.</li>
<li><code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code>&nbsp;works only on single line content.</li>
<li>Various JavaScript solutions are fragile because they need explicit
    relayout whenever the box width or content changes.</li>
</ul><span>
</span><p>We can do better with pure CSS and a little imagination.</p><span>

</span><p>The image above is an animated GIF that shows the <a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/ymHFh">finished product&nbsp;of our CSS
Ellipsis approach</a>. Note how the
ellipsis appears and disappears when the window is made narrower or wider. There
is no JavaScript listening to window resize events or controlling ellipsis
element visibility.</p><span>
</span><p>So what kind of magic is that?</p><span>


</span><h3>CSS Ellipsis Implementation</h3><span>
</span><p>The final CSS Ellipsis result demonstrated in the animated GIF above is
gradually built from basic floats over 9 steps in the tutorial below. If
you want to understand how the technique works, we recommend following
the links and experimenting with code examples. This writeup will
provide more of a high-level overview.</p><span>
</span><p>Obviously, cutting the text off is the easy part. The hard part is
getting an element to appear in the corner of overflowing container then
having it disappear if the container is not overflowing. Since doing
this second feat is difficult, we will start with the opposite â€“ placing
an element in the corner of the container when the container is too
short.</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/wvxbd">
    <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8931" title="01.idea" src="http://dev.mobify.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/01.idea_.png" alt="">
</a></p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/wvxbd">01-idea</a>. Both text samples use fixed height "wrap" elements,
containing three floats inside. The first "prop" float is the measuring
stick against which the content is compared. When the "main" content is
shorter or equal in height to "prop", the "end" element can roam free in
the bottom right corner. When the "main" is longer than "prop", the
"end" element is trapped under "prop".</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/zhweq">02-switchback</a>. Now, let's flip the scenario and make this work
properly by showing the ellipsis element when the content is too long
for the container. For demonstration reasons, we will create a new
"realend" element within "end". The location of "realend" is defined
relative to that of "end", so that when "end" is trapped in the corner,
"realend" lands on the bottom right, and when "end" is free, "realend"
is out of bounds.</p><span>
</span><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">realend</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">position:</span> <span class="n">absolute</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">width:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">top:</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">left:</span> <span class="mi">300</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div><span>


</span><p>This is beginning to look like a proper text-overflow implementation,
but all its plumbing is exposed and widths are fixed.</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/sKnmz"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8932" title="03.relative" src="http://dev.mobify.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/03.switchback.gif" alt=""></a></p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/sKnmz">03-relative</a>. We make no visual changes in this step. However,
we eliminate "end" and place "realend" in the right spot through the use
of&nbsp;<code>position: relative</code> instead of <code>position: absolute</code>.
<code>Position: relative</code> is perfect here because it shifts element for the
purpose of rendering while maintaining its original place for the
purpose of layout.</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/mIKgr">04-narrow</a>. It would be cumbersome to resize "prop" every time the
size of "realend" ellipsis content changes. Instead, we shrink "prop"
and prevent it from wasting space through the use of negative margins.
Note how the negative margin trick on "realend" allows it to fit into 5
pixels of "prop"-held space.</p><span>
</span><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">realend</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">float:</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">position:</span> <span class="n">relative</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">top:</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">left:</span> <span class="mi">300</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nl">width:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">margin</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">padding</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">right</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="n">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div><span>


</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/ntcBf">05-fluid</a>. In this step we switch container widths to percentages to
enable them to scale along with viewport. This is relatively easy to do
because a negative margin on "realend" compensates for its width and
thus allows use of <code>left: 100%</code>.</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/ujfgr">06-sweep</a>. We replace our "prop" and "realend" elements with :before
and :after generated content. This allows the markup structure to be
simplified. Outer "wrap" element is renamed to "ellipsis".</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/frckp">07-overflow</a>. We apply overflow to hide inner workings of the layout.
In addition, the wrapper element is expanded from 50% to 100% because we
are no longer trying to demonstrate placement of the "realend" element
when content text gets too short. Content length is increased to
compensate.</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/ymHFh"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8930" title="ellipsis_animation" src="http://dev.mobify.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ellipsis_animation.gif" alt=""></a></p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/ymHFh">08-complete</a>. We change the content of the :after generated
element to use an actual ellipsis and apply a transparent-to-white
gradient background to hide any text it overlays. Debugging-specific
properties, such as background highlighting and semi-transparency are
now removed and we arrive at our final result.</p><span>
</span><p><a href="http://codepen.io/romanrudenko/pen/bpeDF">09-readmore</a>. We gild the lily a bit by adding Read More text that
appears either as part of overflowed text or part of content, but not
both. We also overlay all the text with a display: block link. This is
better than wrapping content with a link because blocky elements are not
reliably contained inside links.</p><span>
</span><h3>CSS Ellipsis Browser Support</h3><span>
</span><p>So far we have tested on Safari 5.0, IE 9 (must be in standards mode),
Opera 12 and Firefox 15.</p><span>
</span><p>Older browsers will still work quite well, as the meat of the layout is
in normal positioning, margin and padding properties. if your platform
is older (e.g. Firefox 3.6, IE 8), you can use the method but redo the
gradient as a standalone PNG image or DirectX filter.</p><span>
</span><p>Generated content may also be a point of contention for older browsers
but can be replaced with empty elements.</p><span>
</span><h3>CSS Ellipsis Limitations</h3><span>
</span><p>If you rely on a fade out effect, you will need a solid background under
your text. You can also dodge this limitation by using a different
appearance for the overflow indication element, such as a torn or folded
corner or an inkblot.</p><span>
</span><p>Since you will be cutting off multiline text with <code>overflow: hidden</code>,
you need to get your math right to avoid cutting the last line in half.
Pay attention to your vertical grid, and make sure that no matter how
many lines your header(s) and paragraph(s) take, the last line lands in
same spot at the bottom of overflowing container.</p><span>
