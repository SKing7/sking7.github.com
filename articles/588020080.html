<h1>Motion Ui Design Principles — Beyond Kinetic</h1>
<div><p>This blog is a quick look at some simple Ui motion design principles. &nbsp;There isn’t too much documented about this area of mobile ui design and I thought there would be some value in expressing my views. &nbsp;&nbsp;From what is documented already I urge anyone interested in ui motion to check out Pasquale D’Silva&nbsp;http://psql.me/&nbsp;and Johannes Tonollo’s meaningful transitions&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ui-transitions.com/#home">http://www.ui-transitions.com/#home</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Also make sure you bookmark&nbsp;<a href="http://littlebigdetails.com/">http://littlebigdetails.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://capptivate.co/">http://capptivate.co</a>. &nbsp;(<em>A special thank you to Capptivate.co who allowed me to use their captures below</em><em>).</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>These basic principles I’ve outlined focus more on the what and why, rather than the how to of motion / animation. &nbsp;With the increasing emphasis on motion (largely thanks to the more paired back design of iOS 7) its important that it is implemented with the same integrity and purpose as all the other aspects of Ui design. &nbsp;With the exclusion of skeuomorphic design there is now a freedom for content to behave in an unrestricted manner. &nbsp;Gone are the awkward and sometimes absurd transitions that appeared to break all laws of their pre-defined physical environment. &nbsp;Now the space has opened for there to be a much richer identity and defined language or landscape to mobile Ui and motion is very much an integral part of that.</p><p><strong>Personality.</strong></p><p>The most obvious principle is that any motion or animation should be of the highest standard possible. &nbsp;Apps should look at going beyond “out of the box” motion solutions and making something bespoke and truly engaging. &nbsp;Within the app the motion should convey a distinct character, whilst keeping a clear&nbsp;consistency throughout. Behaving in an expected manner&nbsp;will help maintain a stable relationship with the user keeping them engaged with experience. &nbsp;</p></div></div>
