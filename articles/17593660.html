                <blockquote>
The <a href="http://park2.wakwak.com/~tsuruzoh/Computer/Digicams/exif-e.html">Exif specification</a> defines an Orientation Tag to indicate the
orientation of the camera relative to the captured scene. This can be
used by the camera either to indicate the orientation automatically by
an orientation sensor, or to allow the user to indicate the orientation
manually by a menu switch, without actually transforming the image data
itself.
<p>
Here is an explanation given by TsuruZoh Tachibanaya
in his description of the Exif file format:
</p><p>
The orientation of the camera relative to the scene, when the image was
captured. The relation of the '0th row' and '0th column' to visual
position is shown as below.
</p><center><table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td>Value</td><td>0th Row</td><td>0th Column</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>top</td><td>left side</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>top</td><td>right side</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>bottom</td><td>right side</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>bottom</td><td>left side</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>left side</td><td>top</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>right side</td><td>top</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>right side</td><td>bottom</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>left side</td><td>bottom</td></tr>
</tbody></table></center>
Read this table as follows (thanks to Peter Nielsen for clarifying this -
see also below):<br>Entry #6 in the table says that the 0th row <i>in the stored image</i>
is the right side <i>of the captured scene</i>, and the 0th column <i>in
the stored image</i> is the top side <i>of the captured scene</i>.
<p>
Here is another description given by Adam M. Costello:
</p><p>
For convenience, here is what the letter F would look like if it were
tagged correctly and displayed by a program that ignores the orientation
tag (thus showing the stored image):

jpegtran does <b>not</b> change the Orientation Tag when performing lossless
transformations. The reason is that it cannot rely on the validity of the stated
information, and it could potentially confuse other applications if it would
mistakenly rely on the information and change it appropriately.
<p>
Furthermore, if you want automatic correction, then you must examine the field
first to decide whether to call jpegtran at all and if yes with which
transformation option.
</p><p>
Therefore, it has been found that the best solution to the problem would be
to handle the examination and manipulation of the Exif Orientation field by
separate utilities, not jpegtran.
</p><p>
To solve the task of automatic image orientation correction, we therefore provide
two utility programs.
</p><p>
The first utility program is called <font color="#cc0000">jpegexiforient</font>
and is written in simple C. It only can read or write the Orientation Tag.
It writes it out as ASCII character to stdout when called from the commandline.<br>Here is the usage screen:
</p><blockquote><pre>jpegexiforient reads or writes the Exif Orientation Tag in a JPEG Exif file.
Usage: jpegexiforient [switches] jpegfile
Switches:
  --help     display this help and exit
  --version  output version information and exit
  -n         Do not output the trailing newline
  -1 .. -8   Set orientation value 1 .. 8
</pre></blockquote>
The second utility is a simple shell script called
<font color="#cc0000">exifautotran</font>
which transforms Exif files so that Orientation becomes 1.
It first calls jpegexiforient to examine the Orientation
field, and then decides whether and how to call jpegtran so
that Orientation becomes 1.  It then calls jpegexiforient
again to set the Orientation field accordingly to keep the
information consistent.
<p>
So if you run "exifautotran *.jpg" in a directory of JPEG
files, all images will be automatically transformed.  If all
worked well and you would call it again, nothing more would
happen because all Orientation values would have been set to
1 in the first run. This is exactly the desired behaviour.
The script was tested on Linux and worked properly:
</p><blockquote><pre># exifautotran [list of files]
#
# Transforms Exif files so that Orientation becomes 1
#
for i
do
 case `jpegexiforient -n "$i"` in
 1) transform="";;
 2) transform="-flip horizontal";;
 3) transform="-rotate 180";;
 4) transform="-flip vertical";;
 5) transform="-transpose";;
 6) transform="-rotate 90";;
 7) transform="-transverse";;
 8) transform="-rotate 270";;
 *) transform="";;
 esac
 if test -n "$transform"; then
  echo Executing: jpegtran -copy all $transform $i
  jpegtran -copy all $transform "$i" &gt; tempfile
  if test $? -ne 0; then
   echo Error while transforming $i - skipped.
  else
   rm "$i"
   mv tempfile "$i"
   jpegexiforient -1 "$i" &gt; /dev/null
  fi
 fi
done

This <a href="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/exifautotran.txt">shell script as file here</a>.<br>The <a href="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/jpegexiforient.c">jpegexiforient.c source file here</a>.<br>Compile straightforward with "gcc -o jpegexiforient jpegexiforient.c".

It turns out that orientations #6 and #8 are 4-phase in contrast to all
other orientations that are 2-phase. (In retrospective this should have
been obvious because of the 90 degree rotation done in these orientations).
</p><p>
The 2-phase orientaions are of course bi-directional. The 4-phase ones are
not.
</p><p>
Applying a 2-phase orientation on the viewed image gives the stored image
and vice versa. However, this is NOT true for the 4-phase orientations.
</p><p>
(I did not realize this until now, and that's why I made the mistake of
thinking that your page was wrong. I incorrectly assumed that all the
transformations are 2-phase).
</p><p>
I have attached an illustration that shows this. I start off by the case
you picture on your site as phase #0. Notice the interesting phase #3
where orientations #6 and #8 are 180 degrees off.
