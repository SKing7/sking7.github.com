<h1>Taming data tables – CSS Wizardry – CSS, OOCSS, front-end architecture, performance and more, by Harry Roberts</h1>

    <p><code>table</code>s are a pain to work with, there are no two ways about it; they’re
horrible. Tonnes of similar-looking, heavily-nested markup that is completely
inflexible. One of the biggest problems I ever encountered was working on
<a href="http://www.skybet.com/">Sky Bet</a>, whose content is almost exclusively data
tables, and making <code>table</code>s’ cells line up nicely <em>not only</em> with each other,
but also with those cells in other <code>table</code>s on the page.</p>

<p>This is a very complex problem to explain, so I have been sure to create <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/Df2tt/embedded/result%2Chtml%2Ccss/">a
demo</a>.</p>

<h2>The problems</h2>

<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of headaches we encounter when building <code>table</code>s, and I
imagine most of you reading this article will nod along to every point I make;
it will be something that will have annoyed us all at some point or another.
What this particular (and very specific) problem boils down to is trying to
consistently format, size and align complex data layouts across multiple
<code>table</code>s. Imagine a financial report; loads of <code>table</code>s of data with differing
numbers of cells and columns that—from a purely aesthetic perspective—need to
line up in some neat, coherent fashion. Achieving this is made very difficult by
a number of different factors…</p>

<h3>Cell widths</h3>

<p>Tables lay out their cells—by default—in a rather unusual, almost haphazard way.
There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind how and why they are rendered at the
widths they are, which leads to columns and cells of differing sizes.</p>

<h3>Spanning cells</h3>

<p>In order to have cells span several columns (and rows, but that doesn’t pose the
same problems), we have to use the <code>colspan</code> attribute. To have a cell spanning
two columns we would write <code>&lt;t[h|d] colspan="2"&gt;</code>. These are often unmanageable,
and it can be confusing to remember what all your <code>colspan</code>s should add up to.</p>

<h3>Knock-on effects</h3>

<p>Resizing one cell in one row can, and usually will, affect the layout of the
entire <code>table</code>. This is is because all cells’ boundaries have to line up with
the boundaries of the rest of the row and column in which it sits. You can’t
just change the width of one cell, you have to change them <em>all</em>. This means
that, for example, spanning one cell across <var>x</var> columns might mean
having to update a whole load more <code>colspan</code>s elsewhere in the <code>table</code>.</p>

<h3>Tables next to tables</h3>

<p>The above problems are further compounded when you begin laying out multiple
different <code>table</code>s on any given page. In Sky Bet world, this was pretty much
every page. One <code>table</code>’s rendered layout might be vastly different to the
<code>table</code>s above and/or below it, creating an unsightly mess of misaligned
columns. You might have a <code>table</code> with no <code>colspan</code>s above a <code>table</code> with some
<code>colspan</code>s, above a <code>table</code> with lots of awkward <code>colspan</code>s. You might have a
<code>table</code> with lots of cells above a <code>table</code> with very few. You might have any
combination of amounts of cells and amounts of <code>colspan</code>s. It all gets very
hairy, very quickly.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I’ve come up with what <em>I</em> feel is a solid, very pragmatic solution.</p>

<p>There are two parts to solving this problem. Firstly we need to standardise the
number of cells in every table, and then we need to force these cells to all be
the same width. Think of this as a grid system for tables.</p>

<h3>24 cells</h3>

<p>Think about page layouts that adhere to a grid system; you might have a 24
column grid, but your page might only have two main columns which span, say, 16
and eight columns respectively. You can’t <em>see</em> the 24 columns, but they’re
there. You might then have a large footer broken into three columns of eight
(again, adding up to 24).</p>

<p>We need to apply this model to <code>table</code>s; we shall give all <code>table</code>s 24 columns,
and then use a generous amount of <code>colspan</code>s to knock our cells through into
each other, into more useful layouts. Now every <code>table</code> we build will be based
on a 24 column grid which will, firstly, make everything more consistent, and,
secondly, it will make our maths <em>much</em> simpler. We just need to make sure every
row’s <code>colspan</code> values add up to 24 every time.</p>

<p>This does mean that <em>every</em> cell in the <code>table</code> now has to carry a <code>colspan</code>,
but as I said, this solution is a pragmatic one.</p>

<p>The reason we pick 24 is because it can take halves, thirds, quarters, sixths,
eighths and twelfths; we can make a <em>lot</em> of layouts if we have 24 columns to
play with.</p>

<p>Now, we would write this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>...
    &lt;th&gt;Column one&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Column two&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Column three&lt;/th&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>as:</p>

<pre><code>...
    &lt;th colspan="8"&gt;Column one&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="8"&gt;Column two&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="8"&gt;Column three&lt;/th&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>For all this is more markup, it does mean we can begin to standardise our
<code>table</code>s’ layouts so that multiple <code>table</code>s on the same page can share a lowest
common multiple and are now able to be aligned to one another.</p>

<p>The short version of this section is basically: we are setting up a grid system
for our <code>table</code>s.</p>

<h3>Equal width columns</h3>

<p>It’s all well and good that all our <code>table</code>s have the same number of columns,
but that doesn’t escape the fact that browsers will still render every <code>table</code>
differently, and that the size of these cells will always vary. There’s no point
having a 24 column table-grid-system if each column is a different width.
Thankfully, this is the easiest part of the puzzle to solve and, probably, the
most interesting part of this article: <code>table-layout: fixed;</code>.</p>

<p>There is a little known, and even less used, CSS property called <code>table-layout</code>.
<code>table-layout</code> basically tells a browser how to render the columns in a <code>table</code>,
and is, by default, set to <code>auto</code>. <code>auto</code> means that the browser will
automatically render the cells in a <code>table</code> based on their width, which leads to
the differently and inconsistently sized columns.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <code>table-layout: fixed;</code> is the backbone of <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/zfSt4/">my pure CSS,
equal-width tabs</a>.</p>

<p>Setting <code>table-layout</code> to <code>fixed</code> however, tells the browser to render every
cell the same width as each other. Equally-sized table cells right out of the
box!</p>

<h2>Combining the two</h2>

<p>By giving our <code>table</code>s a common grid system of 24 columns, and ensuring these
columns are all of equal width, we can begin throwing together all manner of
layouts.</p>

<p>I would propose that you opt into the table-grid-system via a simple helper
class, perhaps <code>.table-grid</code>:</p>

<pre><code>.table-grid {
    table-layout: fixed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Every time we want to build a <code>table</code> to a fixed and consistent layout, we
simply invoke the grid and lay it out to that.</p>
