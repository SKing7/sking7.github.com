<h1>When Not to Use YUI // Speaker Deck</h1>
<div><p>Video: <a href="http://youtu.be/8cTz73zdDuc?hd=1">http://youtu.be/8cTz73zdDuc?hd=1</a></p><p>In this talk from YUIConf 2012, I provide code samples and real-world anecdotes to illustrate how to decide when to use YUI, when to use vanilla JavaScript, when to consider other libraries, and what the tradeoffs are in terms of performance and maintainability. Advice ranges from simple rules of thumb to more nuanced discussion of complex architectural decisions, with examples drawn from my time working on YUI at Yahoo! and using YUI at SmugMug.</p></div></div>
