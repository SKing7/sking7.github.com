                        <p class="tags">Tags: <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/accessibility/" rel="tag">Accessibility</a>, <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/aria/" rel="tag">ARIA</a>, <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/javascript/" rel="tag">JavaScript</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>One of the most important aspects of accessibility is managing focus and user interaction. By default, all links and form controls can get focus. That allows you to use the tab key to navigate between them and, when one of the elements has focus, activate it by pressing the enter key. This paradigm works amazingly well regardless of the complexity of your web application. As long as a keyboard-only user is able to navigate between links and form controls then it&#8217;s possible to navigate the application.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes web developers try to get a bit too clever in creating their interfaces. What if I want something to look like a link but act like a button? Then you end up seeing a lot of code that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="#" onclick="doSomething()"&gt;I'm a button&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That code should turn your stomach a little bit. It&#8217;s a link that goes nowhere and does nothing. All it does is attach an <code>onclick</code> event handler to give it a purpose. Because the desired appearance for this element currently is link-like, the markup uses a link and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Those who are familiar with ARIA may &#8220;fix&#8221; the problem by using the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="#" role="button" onclick="doSomething()"&gt;I'm a button&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>By setting the ARIA role to button, you&#8217;re now telling the browser and screen readers that this link should be interpreted as a button (that does an action on the page) rather than a link (that navigates you away). This has the same problem as the previous code except that you&#8217;re trying to trick the browser into treating the link as if it were a button. In reality, it would be most appropriate to just use button:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;button onclick="doSomething()"&gt;I'm a button&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The markup to use should never be based on the appearance of a UI element. Instead, you should try to figure out the real purpose of that element and use the appropriate markup. You can always style button to look like a link or a link to look like a button, but those are purely visual distinctions that don&#8217;t change the action.</p>
<p>If these were the worst sins of web applications that I have seen, I would be pretty happy. However, there is another even more disturbing trend that I&#8217;m seeing. Some Web applications are actually trying to create their own buttons by mixing and matching different parts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div tabindex="0" role="button" onclick="doSomething()"&gt;I'm a button&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is a valiant attempt at creating a button out of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. By setting the <code>tabindex</code> attribute, the developer has assured that keyboard users can navigate to it by using the tab key. The value of 0 adds the elements into the normal tab order so it can receive focus just like any other link or button without affecting the overall tabbing order. The <code>role</code> informs the browser and screen readers that this element should be treated as a button and the <code>onclick</code> describes the behavior of the button. </p>
<p>To anyone using a mouse, assuming the styling is correct, there is no distinction between this element and an actual button. You move the mouse over and click down and an action happens. If you&#8217;re using a keyboard, however, there is a subtle but important difference between this and a regular button: almost all browsers will not fire the <code>click</code> event when the element has focus and the enter key is pressed. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all ignore the enter key in this situation (Opera is the only one that fires <code>click</code>). </p>
<p>The enter key fires the <code>click</code> event when used on links and buttons by default. If you try to create your own button, as in the previous example, the enter key has no effect and therefore the user cannot perform that action. </p>
<p>This horrible pattern is found most frequently in Google products. Perhaps the most ironic usage is in Gmail. When you press the ? key, a dialog pops up showing you available keyboard shortcuts and allowing you to enable more advanced shortcuts.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gmail.png"><img src="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gmail-300x153.png" alt="Gmail keyboard shortcuts dialog" width="300" height="153" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3344" /></a></p>
<p>It looks like the word &#8220;Enable&#8221; is a link, so you press tab a few times to give it focus and press enter. Nothing happens. Why? Because the link is actually  neither a linkage nor a button, it&#8217;s a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. Here&#8217;s the actual code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span id=":s7.pl" role="link" class="aoy" tabindex="1"&gt;Enable&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Almost exactly the problematic pattern mentioned earlier in this post. So basically in order to turn on keyboard shortcuts you need to be able to use a mouse. In fact, many of the buttons on Gmail are made in this way. If not for the keyboard shortcuts it would basically be unusable without a mouse.</p>
<p>Gmail isn&#8217;t the only Google site that uses this pattern. It can be found throughout the network of Google sites, including Google Groups and Google Analytics (which also hides focus rectangles). This alone makes Google products incredibly challenging to use for sighted users who don&#8217;t use pointing devices.</p>
<p>If you expect the user to interact with something, then you need to use either a link or button. These have the correct behaviors both in terms of getting focus and activating when the enter key is pressed. Links should be used whenever the action is a navigation (changes the URL) and buttons should be used for all other actions. You can easily styled these to create the visual effect that you want, but nothing can replace the  accessibility of the native links and buttons.</p>

            <p>So do you suggest we only use the button tag when interacting with Javascript? What if we want a click handler but its not necessarily a button? Also what about the crawl-ability of buttons and their values, do we know the differences with Googles take on these?</p>
<p>Great post, thanks.</p>

            <p>Oh, there are too many problems with buttons. Assuming you wan&#8217;t to style them nicely.<br />
On FF you need to kill the inner focus, on IE you need hacks to vertically center the text (different hacks for different versions), on Opera you need to kill the &#8220;press-down&#8221; effect. Too much CSS hackery and generally not worth the trouble.</p>

            <p>What about an additional keypress event?</p>
<p>My first choice is always a button, but when not possible (styling issues), I do this:</p>
<p><code><br />
<a>Button</a><br />
</code></p>
<p><code><br />
myButton.addEventListener('click', myAction, false);<br />
myButton.addEventListener('keypress', function(event){<br />
  if (event.keyCode === 13) myAction(event);<br />
}, false);<br />
</code></p>
<p>Not to mention the additional complexity, nor the approach which is too “concrete” (we explicitly address the case of a keyboard / enter key, so it’s kind of wrong by design), do you see something wrong with this method?</p>

            <p>The &lt;button&gt; element has a default type of “submit” – so in your use case, you’d want to add `type=”button”` so that it’s a no-op when JS is disabled.</p>

            <p>@Nicholas – <q>Why not just use a button?</q></p>
<p>That’s what I do most of the time, I totally agree about the pile of hacks. I was just curious to read your opinion about this solution.</p>
<p>Buttons are extremely hard to style right, and it’s very verbose (we have to deal specifically with: IE on multiple versions, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, active and focus, and active-then-release-outside). Not to mention the case where you want to style your button exactly like the links of your website (e.g. a small “cancel”, “remove”).</p>
<p>Anyway, as I said, I prefer the CSS solution most of the time: this is already the most hacked part in the web stack, so I prefer to keep my JS and my HTML as clean as possible (ie not very clean when we talk about a complex web app :] ).</p>
<p>That said, I totally understand that the <code>a role=button</code> + JS could be preferred, and while I always prefer to use the right tool for the job (which is obviously a button), I happened to choose this solution (can’t remember exactly why).</p>

            <p>@Pierre &#8211; I may be missing something, but I&#8217;ve never had as much trouble as you described here. I style buttons as links on WellFurnished and it works absolutely fine. In IE8 and below there is a slight alignment discrepancy, but other than that, I find styling buttons to be very easy. There are also a large amount of examples of how to style buttons online.</p>

            <p>Reminds me that I once wrote 10,000 words on <a href="http://koranteng.blogspot.com/2005/05/unloved-html-button-and-other.html" rel="nofollow">The Unloved HTML Button and Other Folktales</a>. I am continually amazed about designers who misuse links when a button would do.</p>

            <p>@Nicholas Yes, I think that you mean relatively simple buttons, with minor and acceptable style issues, which is indeed easy. I am talking about perfectly styling buttons, with the possibility to do everything you can already do with a <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. At this point, the discussion may become highly subjective, I guess we should talk about actual demos :-)</p>
<p>PS: That’s exactly the debate I was trying to avoid ha ha, I’m (almost) as convinced as you about the buttons. I just wanted to know if you had another real issue in mind, out of the enter key. I know it’s conceptually broken.</p>
