</span><h2 id="toc-intro">Introduction</h2><span>

</span><p>One of the features of today's complex device landscape is that there's
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density">very wide range of screen pixel densities</a> available.
Some devices feature very high resolution displays, while others
straggle behind. Application developers need to support a range of
pixel densities, which can be quite challenging. On the mobile web, the
challenges are compounded by several factors:</p><span>

</span><ul>
<li>Large variety of devices with different form factors.</li>
<li>Constrained network bandwidth and battery life.</li>
</ul><span>

</span><p>In terms of images, the goal of web app developers is to <strong>serve the
best quality images as efficiently as possible</strong>. This article will
cover some useful techniques for doing this today and in the near
future.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-avoid">Avoid images if possible</h3><span>

</span><p>Before opening this can of worms, remember that the web has many
powerful technologies that are largely resolution- and DPI-independent.
Specifically, text, SVG and much of CSS will "just work" because of the
automatic pixel scaling feature of the web (via
<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/06/devicepixelrati.html">devicePixelRatio</a>).</p><span>

</span><p>That said, you can't always avoid raster images. For example, you may be
given assets that would be quite hard to replicate in pure SVG/CSS, or
you are dealing with a photograph. While you could convert the image
into SVG automatically, vectorizing photographs makes little sense
because scaled-up versions usually don't look good.</p><span>

</span><h2 id="toc-bg">Background</h2><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-history">A very short history of display density</h3><span>

</span><p>In the early days, computer displays had a pixel density of 72 or 96dpi
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dots per inch</a>).</p><span>

</span><p>Displays gradually improved in pixel density, largely driven by the
mobile use case, in which users generally hold their phones closer to
their faces, making pixels more visible. By 2008, 150dpi phones were the
new norm. The trend in increased display density continued, and today's
new phones sport 300dpi displays (branded "Retina" by Apple).</p><span>

</span><p>The holy grail, of course, is a display in which pixels are completely
invisible. For the phone form factor, the current generation of
Retina/HiDPI displays may be close to that ideal. But new classes of
hardware and wearables like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Glass">Project Glass</a> will likely continue
to drive increased pixel density.</p><span>

</span><p>In practice, low density images should look the same on new screens as
they did on old ones, but compared to the crisp imagery high density
users are used to seeing, the low density images look jarring and
pixelated. The following is a rough simulation of how a 1x image will
look on a 2x display. In contrast, the 2x image looks quite good.</p><span>

</span><figure>

<figcaption>Baboons! at differing pixel densities.</figcaption>
</figure><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-pixels-web">Pixels on the web</h3><span>

</span><p>When the web was designed, 99% of displays were 96dpi (or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fontblog/archive/2005/11/08/490490.aspx">pretended to
be</a>), and few provisions were made for variation on this
front. Because of a large variation in screen sizes and densities, we
needed a standard way to make images look good across a variety of
screen densities and dimensions.</p><span>

</span><p>The <a href="http://inamidst.com/stuff/notes/csspx">HTML specification</a> recently tackled this problem by
defining a reference pixel that manufacturers use to determine the size
of a CSS pixel.</p><span>

</span><blockquote>
  <p>It is recommended that the reference pixel be the visual angle of one
  pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from
  the reader of an arm's length. For a nominal arm's length of 28
  inches, the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees.</p>
</blockquote><span>

</span><p>Using the reference pixel, a manufacturer can determine the size of the
deviceâ€™s physical pixel relative to the standard or ideal pixel. This
ratio is called the device pixel ratio.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-calculating-dpr">Calculating the device pixel ratio</h3><span>

</span><p>Suppose a smart phone has a screen with a physical pixel size of 180
pixels per inch (ppi). Calculating the device pixel ratio takes three
steps:</p><span>

</span><ol>
<li><p>Compare the actual distance at which the device is held to the
distance for the reference pixel.</p>

<p>Per the spec, we know that at 28 inches, the ideal is 96 pixels per
inch. However, since it's a smart phone, people hold the device closer
to their faces than they hold a laptop. Let's estimate that distance to
be 18 inches.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiply the distance ratio against the standard density (96ppi) to
get the ideal pixel density for the given distance.</p>

<p>idealPixelDensity = (28/18) * 96 = 150 pixels per inch (approximately)</p></li>
<li><p>Take the ratio of the physical pixel density to the ideal pixel
density to get the device pixel ratio.</p>

<p><code>devicePixelRatio</code> = 180/150 = 1.2</p></li>
</ol><span>

</span><figure>
<img src="http://www.html5rocks.com/static/demos/high-dpi/calculate-dpr.png">
<figcaption>A diagram showing one reference angular pixel, to help
illustrate how devicePixelRatio is calculated.</figcaption>
</figure><span>

</span><p>So now when a browser needs to know how to resize an image to fit the
screen according to the ideal or standard resolution, the browser refers
to the device pixel ratio of 1.2 - which says, for every ideal pixel,
this device has 1.2 physical pixels. The formula to go between ideal
(as defined by the web spec) and physical (dots on device screen) pixels
is the following:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>physicalPixels = window.devicePixelRatio * idealPixels
</code></pre><span>

</span><p>Historically, device vendors have tended to round <code>devicePixelRatios</code>
(DPRs). Apple's iPhone and iPad report DPR of 1, and their Retina
equivalents report 2. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#length-units">CSS specification</a> recommends that</p><span>

</span><blockquote>
  <p>the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that best
  approximates the reference pixel.</p>
</blockquote><span>

</span><p>One reason why round ratios can be better is because they may lead to
fewer <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/sub-pixel-problems-in-css/">sub-pixel artifacts</a>.</p><span>

</span><p>However, the reality of the device landscape is much more varied, and
Android phones often have DPRs of 1.5. The Nexus 7 tablet has a DPR of
~1.33, which was arrived at by a calculation similar to the one above.
Expect to see more devices with variable DPRs in the future. Because of
this, you should never assume that your clients will have integer DPRs.</p><span>

</span><h2 id="toc-tech-overview">Overview of HiDPI image techniques</h2><span>

</span><p>There are many techniques for solving the problem of showing the best
quality images as fast as possible, broadly falling into two categories:</p><span>

</span><ol>
<li>Optimizing single images, and </li>
<li>Optimizing selection between multiple images.</li>
</ol><span>

</span><p>Single image approaches: use one image, but do something clever with it.
These approaches have the drawback that you will inevitably sacrifice
performance, since you will be downloading HiDPI images even on older
devices with lower DPI. Here are some approaches for the single image
case:</p><span>

</span><ul>
<li>Heavily compressed HiDPI image</li>
<li>Totally awesome image format</li>
<li>Progressive image format</li>
</ul><span>

</span><p>Multiple image approaches: use multiple images, but do something clever
to pick which to load. These approaches have inherent overhead for the
developer to create multiple versions of the same asset and then figure
out a decision strategy. Here are the options:</p><span>

</span><ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Server side delivery</li>
<li>CSS media queries</li>
<li>Built-in browser features (<code>image-set()</code>, <code>&lt;img srcset&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-compress">Heavily compressed HiDPI image</h3><span>

</span><p>Images already <a href="http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#bytesperpage">comprise a whopping 60% of bandwidth</a> spent downloading an
average website. By serving HiDPI images to all clients, we will
increase this number. How much bigger will it grow?</p><span>

</span><p>I ran some tests which generated 1x and 2x image fragments with JPEG
quality at 90, 50 and 20. Here is <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/static/demos/high-dpi/process_images.sh">shell script</a> I used
(employing <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a>) to generate them:</p><span>

</span><figure>

<figcaption>Samples of images at different compressions and pixel
densities.</figcaption>
</figure><span>

</span><p>From this small, unscientific sampling, it seems that compressing large
images provides a good quality-to-size tradeoff. For my eye, heavily
compressed 2x imagery actually looks better than uncompressed 1x
pictures.</p><span>

</span><p>Of course, serving low quality, highly compressed 2x imagery to 2x
devices is worse than serving higher quality ones, and the above
approach incurs image quality penalties. If you compare quality: 90
images to quality: 20 images, you will see a drop in crispness and
increased graininess. These artifacts may not be acceptable in cases
where high quality images are key (for example, a photo viewer
application), or for app developers that are not willing to compromise.</p><span>

</span><p>The above comparison was made entirely with compressed JPEGs. It's worth
noting that there are <a href="http://www.labnol.org/software/tutorials/jpeg-vs-png-image-quality-or-bandwidth/5385/">many tradeoffs</a> between the widely
implemented image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF), which brings us to...</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-new-image-format">Totally awesome image format</h3><span>

</span><p>WebP is a pretty <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_alpha_study">compelling image format</a> that compresses
very well while keeping high image fidelity. Of course, it's <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=webp">not
implemented everywhere</a> yet!</p><span>

</span><p>One way is to check for WebP support is via JavaScript. You load a 1px
image via data-uri, wait for either loaded or error events fired, and
then verify that the size is correct. <a href="http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/test/">Modernizr</a> ships with
such a <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/commit/d1fa2a62d7912d5f253ac1ab9ae2ce9430c3ef92">feature detection script</a>, which is available
via <code>Modernizr.webp</code>.</p><span>

</span><p>A better way of doing this, however, is directly
in CSS using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/#image-notation">image() function</a>. So if you have a WebP
image and JPEG fallback, you can write the following:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>#pic {
  background: image("foo.webp", "foo.jpg");
}
</code></pre><span>

</span><p>There are a few problems with this approach. Firstly, <code>image()</code> is not
at all widely implemented. Secondly, while WebP compression blows JPEG
out of the water, it's still a relatively incremental improvement â€“
about 30% smaller based on this <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/gallery1">WebP gallery</a>. Thus, WebP
alone isn't enough to address the high DPI problem.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-prog">Progressive image formats</h3><span>

</span><p>Progressive image formats like JPEG 2000, Progressive JPEG, Progressive
PNG and GIF have the (somewhat debated) benefit of seeing the image come
into place before it's fully loaded. They may incur some size overhead,
though there is conflicting evidence about this. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/12/progressive-image-rendering.html">Jeff Atwood
claimed</a> that progressive mode "adds about 20% to the size of PNG images, and
about 10% to the size of JPEG and GIF images". However, <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2008/12/05/imageopt-4/">Stoyan Stefanov
claimed</a> that for large files, progressive mode is more efficient (in
most cases).</p><span>

</span><p>At first glance, progressive images look very promising in the context
of serving the best quality images as fast as possible. The idea is
that the browser can stop downloading and decoding an image once it
knows that additional data won't increase the image quality (ie. all of
the fidelity improvements are sub-pixel).</p><span>

</span><p>While connections are easy to terminate, they are often expensive to
restart. For a site with many images, the most efficient approach is to
keep a single HTTP connection alive, reusing it for as long as possible.
If the connection is terminated prematurely because one image has been
downloaded enough, the browser then needs to create a new connection,
which can be really <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/387627/why-do-mobile-networks-have-high-latencies-how-can-they-be-reduced">slow in low latency</a> environments.</p><span>

</span><p>One workaround to this is to use the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1434647/using-the-http-range-header-with-a-range-specifier-other-than-bytes">HTTP Range</a> request, which lets
browsers specify a range of bytes to fetch. A smart browser could make a
HEAD request to get at the header, process it, decide how much of the
image is actually needed, and then fetch. Unfortunately HTTP Range is
poorly supported in web servers, making this approach impractical.</p><span>

</span><p>Finally, an obvious limitation of this approach is that you don't get to
choose which image to load, only varying fidelities of the same image.
As a result, this doesn't address the "<a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/a-framework-for-discussing-responsive-images-solutions/">art direction</a>" use case.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-js">Use JavaScript to decide which image to load</h3><span>

</span><p>The first, and most obvious approach to deciding which image to load is
to use JavaScript in the client. This approach lets you find out
everything about your user agent and do the right thing. You can
determine device pixel ratio via <code>window.devicePixelRatio</code>, get screen
width and height, and even potentially do some network connection
sniffing via navigator.connection or issuing a fake request, like the
<a href="https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js">foresight.js library</a> does. Once you've collected all of
this information, you can decide which image to load.</p><span>

</span><p>There are approximately <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0lI17fOl9DdDgxTFVoRzFpV3VCdHk2NTBmdVI2OXc#gid=0">one million JavaScript libraries</a> that
do something like the above, and unfortunately none of them are
particularly outstanding.</p><span>

</span><p>One big drawback to this approach is that using JavaScript means that
you will delay image loading until after the look-ahead parser has
finished. This essentially means that images won't even start
downloading until after the <code>pageload</code> event fires.  More on this in
<a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-real-conflict-behind-picture-and-srcset/">Jason Grigsby's article</a>.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-server">Decide what image to load on the server</h3><span>

</span><p>You can defer the decision to the server-side by writing custom request
handlers for each image you serve. Such a handler would check for Retina
support based on User-Agent (the only piece of information relayed to
the server). Then, based on whether the server-side logic wants to serve
HiDPI assets, you load the appropriate asset (named according to some
known convention).</p><span>

</span><p>Unfortunately, the User-Agent doesn't necessarily provide enough
information to decide whether a device should receive high or low
quality images. Also, it goes without saying that anything related to
User-Agent is a hack and should be avoided if possible.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-css">Use CSS media queries</h3><span>

</span><p>Being declarative, CSS media queries let you state your intention, and
let the browser do the right thing on your behalf. In addition to the most
common use of media queries â€” matching device size â€” you can
also match <code>devicePixelRatio</code>. The associated media query is
device-pixel-ratio, and has associated min and max variants, as you
might expect. If you want to load high DPI images and the device pixel
ratio exceeds a threshold, here's what you might do:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>#my-image { background: (low.png); }

@media only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
  #my-image { background: (high.png); }
}
</code></pre><span>

</span><p>It gets a little more complicated with all of the vendor prefixes mixed
in, especially because of insane <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/Media_queries#-moz-device-pixel-ratio">differences in placement</a> of
"min" and "max" prefixes:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>@media only screen and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
    (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2),
    (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
    (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {

  #my-image {
    background:url(high.png);
  }
}
</code></pre><span>

</span><p>With this approach, you regain the benefits of look-ahead parsing, which
was lost with the JS solution. You also gain the flexibility of choosing
your responsive breakpoints (for example, you can have low, mid and high
DPI images), which was lost with the server-side approach.</p><span>

</span><p>Unfortunately it's still a little unwieldy, and leads to strange looking
CSS (or requires preprocessing). Also, this approach is restricted to
CSS properties, so there's no way to set an <code>&lt;img src&gt;</code>, and your images
must all be elements with a background. Finally, by relying strictly on
device pixel ratio, you can end up in situations where your High-DPI
smart phone ends up downloading a massive 2x image asset while on an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution">EDGE connection</a>. This isn't the best user experience.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-bf">Use new browser features</h3><span>

</span><p>There's been a lot of recent discussion around web platform support for
the high DPI image problem. Apple recently broke into the space,
bringing the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css4-images/#image-set-notation">image-set()</a> CSS function to WebKit. As a result, both
Safari and Chrome support it. Since it's a CSS function, <code>image-set()</code>
doesn't address the problem for <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags. Enter
<a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#attr-img-srcset">@srcset</a>, which addresses this issue but (at the time of
this writing) has no reference implementations (yet!). The next section
goes deeper into <code>image-set</code> and <code>srcset</code>.</p><span>

</span><h2 id="toc-bff">Browser features for high DPI support</h2><span>

</span><p>Ultimately, the decision about which approach you take depends on your
particular requirements. That said, keep in mind that all of the
aforementioned approaches have drawbacks. Looking forward, however, once
<code>image-set</code> and srcset are widely supported, they will be the
appropriate solutions to this problem. For the time being, let's talk
about some best practices that can bring us as close to that ideal
future as possible.</p><span>

</span><p>Firstly, how are these two different? Well, <code>image-set()</code> is a CSS
function, appropriate for use as a value of the background CSS property.
srcset is an attribute specific to <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements, with similar syntax.
Both of these tags let you specify image declarations, but the srcset
attribute lets you also configure which image to load based on viewport
size.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-image-set">Best practices for image-set</h3><span>

</span><p>The <code>image-set()</code> CSS function is available prefixed as
<code>-webkit-image-set()</code>. The syntax is quite simple, taking a one or more
comma separated image declarations, which consist of a URL string or
<code>url()</code> function followed by the associated resolution. For example:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>background-image:  -webkit-image-set(
  url(icon1x.jpg) 1x,
  url(icon2x.jpg) 2x
);
</code></pre><span>

</span><p>What this tells the browser is that there are two images to choose from.
One of them is optimized for 1x displays, and the other for 2x displays.
The browser then gets to choose which one to load, based on a variety of
factors, which might even include network speed, if the browser is smart
enough (not currently implemented as far as I know).</p><span>

</span><p>In addition to loading the correct image, the browser will also scale it
accordingly. In other words, the browser assumes that 2 images are
twice as large as 1x images, and so will scale the 2x image down by a
factor of 2, so that the image appears to be the same size on the page.</p><span>

</span><p>Instead of specifying 1x, 1.5x or Nx, you can also specify a certain
device pixel density in dpi.</p><span>

</span><p>This works well, except in browsers that don't support the <code>image-set</code>
property, which will show no image at all! This is clearly bad, so you
<strong>must</strong> use a fallback (or series of fallbacks) to address that issue:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>background-image: url(icon1x.jpg);
background-image: -webkit-image-set(
  url(icon1x.jpg) 1x,
  url(icon2x.jpg) 2x
);
/* This will be useful if image-set gets into the platform, unprefixed.
   Also include other prefixed versions of this */
background-image: image-set(
  url(icon1x.jpg) 1x,
  url(icon2x.jpg) 2x
);
</code></pre><span>

</span><p>The above will load the appropriate asset in browsers that support
image-set, and fall back to the 1x asset otherwise. The obvious caveat
is that while <code>image-set()</code> browser support is low, most user agents will
get the 1x asset.</p><span>

</span><p><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/static/demos/high-dpi/image-set/index.html">This demo</a> uses the <code>image-set()</code> to load the correct
image, falling back to the 1x asset if this CSS function isn't
supported.</p><span>

</span><p>At this point, you may be wondering why not just polyfill (that is,
build a JavaScript shim for) <code>image-set()</code> and call it a day? As it
turns out, it's quite difficult to implement efficient polyfills for CSS
functions. (For a detailed explanation why, see this <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jul/0023.html">www-style
discussion</a>).</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-srcset">Image srcset</h3><span>

</span><p>Here is an example of srcset:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;img alt="my awesome image"
  src="banner.jpeg"
  srcset="banner-HD.jpeg 2x, banner-phone.jpeg 640w, banner-phone-HD.jpeg 640w 2x"&gt;
</code></pre><span>

</span><p>As you can see, in addition to x declarations that <code>image-set</code> provides,
the srcset element also takes w and h values which correspond to the
size of the viewport, attempting to serve the most relevant version. The
above would serve banner-phone.jpeg to devices with viewport width under
640px, banner-phone-HD.jpeg to small screen high DPI devices,
banner-HD.jpeg to high DPI devices with screens greater than 640px, and
banner.jpeg to everything else.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-image-set-srcset">Using image-set for image elements</h3><span>

</span><p>Because the srcset attribute on img elements is not implemented in most
browsers, it may be tempting to replace your img elements with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s
with backgrounds and use the image-set approach. This will work, with
caveats. The drawback here is that the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag has long-time
semantic value. In practice, this is important mostly for web crawlers
and accessibility reasons.</p><span>

</span><p>If you end up using <code>-webkit-image-set</code>, you might be tempted to use the
background CSS property. The drawback of this approach is that you need
to specify image size, which is unknown if you are using a non-1x image.
Rather than doing this, you can use the content CSS property as follows:</p><span>

</span><pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;div id="my-content-image"
  style="content: -webkit-image-set(
    url(icon1x.jpg) 1x,
    url(icon2x.jpg) 2x);"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</span><p>This will automatically scale the image based on devicePixelRatio. See
<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/static/demos/high-dpi/image-set/as-content.html">this example</a> of the above technique in action,
with an additional fallback to <code>url()</code> for browsers that don't support
<code>image-set</code>.</p><span>

</span><h3 id="toc-polyfill">Polyfilling srcset</h3><span>

</span><p>One handy feature of <code>srcset</code> is that it comes with a natural fallback.
In the case where the srcset attribute is not implemented, all browsers
know to process the src attribute. Also, since it's just an HTML
attribute, it's possible to create <a href="https://github.com/borismus/srcset-polyfill">polyfills with
JavaScript</a>.</p><span>

</span><p>This polyfill comes with <a href="https://github.com/borismus/srcset-polyfill/blob/master/tests/srcset-tests.js">unit tests</a> to ensure that it's
as close to the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#attr-img-srcset">specification</a> as possible. In addition, there
are checks in place that prevent the polyfill from executing any code if
srcset is implemented natively.</p><span>

</span><p>Here is a <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/static/demos/high-dpi/srcset-polyfill/demo/index.html">demo of the polyfill</a> in action.</p><span>

</span><h2 id="toc-conclusion">Conclusion</h2><span>

</span><p>There is no magic bullet for solving the problem of high DPI images.</p><span>

</span><p>The easiest solution is to avoid images entirely, opting for SVG and CSS
instead. However, this isn't always realistic, especially if you have
high quality imagery on your site.</p><span>

</span><p>Approaches in JS, CSS and using the server-side all have their strengths
and weaknesses. The most promising approach, however, is to leverage new
browser features. Though browser support for <code>image-set</code> and <code>srcset</code> is
still incomplete, there are reasonable fallbacks to use today.</p><span>

</span><p>To summarize, my recommendations are as follows:</p><span>

</span><ul>
<li>For background images, use <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/high-dpi/#toc-image-set">image-set</a> with the
appropriate fallbacks for browsers that don't support it.</li>
<li>For content images, use a <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/high-dpi/#toc-polyfill">srcset polyfill</a>, or
fallback to <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/high-dpi/#toc-image-set-srcset">using image-set</a> (see above).</li>
<li>For situations where you're willing to sacrifice image quality,
consider using heavily <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/high-dpi/#toc-compress">compressed 2x images</a>.</li>
