Getting response headers is easy: run <tt>curl -D- -o/dev/null -sS
[url]</tt> or load the site in a browser with the networking tab open.
Getting request headers is harder, because webservers don't have a way
to dump this exactly as they received it.  Yes, you can set them to
log specific headers, but logging all headers exactly as they came over
the wire isn't something I see in nginx or apache.  Netcat can help
here.  Start it up on some unused port:


</p><pre>    nc -lp 8070
</pre><span>

Now make the thing you're debugging visit </span><tt>yoursite:8070</tt><span>.
Netcat will print out what headers you got:

</span><pre>    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.jefftk.com:8070
    Referer: http://www.jefftk.com/...
    Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
    Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache
    Accept-Language: en-US
    Connection: Keep-alive
    Accept: */*
    Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
    ...
</pre><span>

See the duplicate </span><tt>Accept-Encoding</tt><span> header?  It turned out that
A was adding an extra encoding header which then made B disable
gzip. [1] Once I had the raw headers as sent it was pretty clear what
the problem was.

</span><p>

(Because the problem was a duplicated header I'm glad I didn't go with
a higher level tool that might have masked that problem by storing
headers in hashtable or something.)

<br>[1] Sniffing the traffic would have been ideal, but I wasn't in a position
to get in between them.
