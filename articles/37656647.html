<h3>
Basic Memory Concepts
</h3>
   In order to understand the concept of big and little endian, you
need to understand memory.   Fortunately, we only need a very high
level abstraction for memory.   You don't need to know all the little
details of how memory works.
<p>
   All you need to know about memory is that it's one large array.
But one large array containing what?  The array contains <i>bytes</i>.
In computer organization, people don't use the term "index" to
refer to the array locations.  Instead, we use the term "address".
"address" and "index" mean the same, so if you're getting confused,
just think of "address" as "index".
</p><p>
   Each address stores one element of the memory "array".  Each
element is typically one byte.   There are some memory configurations
where each address stores something besides a byte.  For example, you
might store a nybble or a bit.   However, those are exceedingly
rare, so for now, we make the broad assumption that all memory addresses
store bytes.
</p><p>
    I will sometimes say that memory is <i>byte-addresseable</i>.
This is just a fancy way of saying that each address stores one
byte.  If I say memory is <i>nybble-addressable</i>, that means
each memory address stores one nybble.
<h3>
Storing Words in Memory
</h3>
   We've defined a word to mean 32 bits.  This is the same as 4 bytes.
Integers, single-precision floating point numbers, and MIPS instructions
are all 32 bits long.   How can we store these values into memory?
After all, each memory address can store a single byte, not 4 bytes.
</p><p>
   The answer is simple.  We split the 32 bit quantity into 4 bytes.
For example, suppose we have a 32 bit quantity, written as
90AB12CD<sub>16</sub>, which is hexadecimal.  Since each hex digit
is 4 bits, we need 8 hex digits to represent the 32 bit value.
</p><p>
   So, the 4 bytes are: 90, AB, 12, CD where each byte requires
2 hex digits.
</p><p>
   It turns out there are two ways to store this in memory.
<h4>
Big Endian
</h4>
   In big endian, you store the most significant byte in the smallest
address.  Here's how it would look:
</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
 <td align="center" bgcolor="pink"> Address</td>
 <td align="center" bgcolor="#aaffaa"> Value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1000</td>
 <td align="center"> 90 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1001</td>
 <td align="center"> AB </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1002</td>
 <td align="center"> 12 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1003</td>
 <td align="center"> CD </td>
</tr>
</table>

</center>

<h4>
Little Endian
</h4>
   In little endian, you store the <i>least</i> significant byte in
the smallest address.  Here's how it would look:
</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
 <td align="center" bgcolor="pink"> Address</td>
 <td align="center" bgcolor="#aaffaa"> Value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1000</td>
 <td align="center"> CD </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1001</td>
 <td align="center"> 12 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1002</td>
 <td align="center"> AB </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td align="center"> 1003</td>
 <td align="center"> 90 </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
   Notice that this is in the reverse order compared to big endian.
To remember which is which, recall whether the least significant
byte is stored first (thus, little endian) or the most significant
byte is stored first (thus, big endian).
</p><p>
   Notice I used "byte" instead of "bit" in least significant bit.
I sometimes abbreciated this as LSB and MSB, with the 'B' capitalized
to refer to byte and use the lowercase 'b' to represent bit.  I only
refer to most and least significant byte when it comes to endianness.
<h3>
Which Way Makes Sense?
</h3>    
   Different ISAs use different endianness.  While one way may seem
more natural to you (most people think big-endian is more natural),
there is justification for either one.
</p><p>
    For example, DEC and IBMs(?) are little endian, while Motorolas
and Suns are big endian.  MIPS processors allowed you to select
a configuration where it would be big or little endian.
</p><p>
    Why is endianness so important?  Suppose you are storing int
values to a file, then you send the file to a machine which uses the
opposite endianness and read in the value.  You'll run into problems
because of endianness.   You'll read in reversed values that won't
make sense.
</p><p>
    Endianness is also a big issue when sending numbers over
the network.   Again, if you send a value from a machine of one
endianness to a machine of the opposite endianness, you'll have
problems.   This is even worse over the network, because you might
not be able to determine the endianness of the machine that sent you
the data.
</p><p>
    The solution is to send 4 byte quantities using <i>network byte order</i>
which is arbitrarily picked to be one of the endianness (not sure if it's
big or little, but it's one of them).   If your machine has the same
endianness as network byte order, then great, no change is needed.
If not, then you must reverse the bytes.
<h3>
History of Endian-ness
</h3>    
   Where does this term "endian" come from?  Jonathan Swift was a satirist
(he poked fun at society through his writings).  His most famous book
is "Gulliver's Travels", and he talks about how certain people prefer
to eat their hard boiled eggs from the little end first (thus, little
endian), while others prefer to eat from the big end (thus, big endians)
and how this lead to various wars.
</p><p>
    Of course, the point was to say that it was a silly thing to debate
over, and yet, people argue over such trivialities all the time (for
example, should braces line in parallel or not? vi or emacs? UNIX or
Windows).
<h3>
Misconceptions
</h3>    
   Endianness only makes sense when you want to break a large
value (such as a word) into several small ones.  You must decide
on an order to place it in memory.
</p><p>
   However, if you have a 32 bit register storing a 32 bit value,
it makes no sense to talk about endianness.   The register is
<i>neither</i> big endian <i>nor</i> little endian.  It's just
a register holding a 32 bit value.   The rightmost bit is the
least significant bit, and the leftmost bit is the most significant
bit.
</p><p>
   There's no reason to rearrange the bytes in a register in some
other way.  
</p><p> 
   Endianness only makes sense when you are breaking up a multi-byte
quantity, and attempting to store the bytes at consecutive memory
locations.  In a register, it doesn't make sense.  A register
is simply a 32 bit quantity, <b>b<sub>31</sub>....b<sub>0</sub></b>,
and endianness does not apply to it.
</p><p>
   With regard to endianness, You may argue there's a very natural way
to store 4 bytes in 4 consecutive addresses, and that the other way
looks strange.  In particular, it looks "backwards".  However, what's
natural to you may not be natural to someone else.  The fact of the
matter is that the word is split in 4 bytes, and most people would
agree that you need <i>some</i> order to place it in memory.
<h4>
C-style strings
</h4>
   Once you start thinking about endianness, you begin to think it
applies to everything.   Before you see big or little endian, you
may have had no idea it even existed.   That's because it's reasonably
well-hidden from you.
</p><p>
    If you do bitwise/bitshift operations on an int, you don't notice
the endianness.  The machine arranges the multiple bytes so the least
significant byte is still the least significant byte (e.g.,
<b>b<sub>7-0</sub></b>) and the most significant byte is still the
most significant byte (e.g., <b>b<sub>31-24</sub></b>).
</p><p>
    So, it's natural to think whether strings might be saved in
some sort of strange order, depending on the machine.
</p><p>
    This is where it's useful to think about all the facts you
know about arrays.   A C-style string, after all, is still an
array of characters.
</p><p>
   Here are some facts you should know about C-style strings and arrays.
</p><p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li> C-style strings are stored in arrays of characters.
  </li><li> Each character requires one byte of memory, since characters
   are represented in ASCII (in the future, this could change, as
   Unicode becomes more popular).
  </li><li> In an array, the address of consecutive array elements increases.
  Thus, <b>&amp; arr[ i ]</b> is less than <b>&amp; arr[ i + 1 ]</b>.
  </li><li> What's not as obvious is that if something is stored in increasing
   addresses in memory, it's going to be stored in increasing "addresses"
   in a file.   When you write to a file, you usually specify an address
   in memory, and the number of bytes you wish to write to the file starting
   at that address.
</li></ul>
    So, let's imagine some C-style string in memory.  You have the word
"cat".  Let's pretend 'c' is stored at address 1000.  Then 'a' is
stored at 1001.  't' is at 1002.  The null character '\0' is at 1003.
</p><p>
    Since C-style strings are arrays of characters, they follow the
rules of characters.  Unlike int or long, you can easily see the
individual bytes of a C-style string, one byte at a time.  You use
array indexing to access the bytes (i.e., characters) of a string.
You can't easily index the bytes of an int or long, without playing
some pointer tricks (using reinterpret cast, for example, in C++).
The individual bytes of an int are more or less hidden from you.
</p><p>
    Now imagine writing out this string to a file using some sort
of <b>write()</b> method.   You specify a pointer to 'c', and the number
of bytes you wish to print (in this case 4).  The <b>write()</b> method
proceeds byte by byte in the character string and writes it to the file,
starting with 'c' and working to the null character.
</p><p>
    Given that explanation, is it clear whether endianness matters
with C-style strings?  Hopefully, it is clear.
</p><p>
    As an aside, since C++ strings are objects, it may have
complicated inner structures, and so it's less obvious what a C++
string would look like when print out to a file.   It's well-known
what a C-style string looks like (a sequence of characters ending
in a null character), which is why I've been careful to call
them C-style strings.
