<h1>The power of inherit or how to animate pseudo elements</h1>
<div>
                
                <p>Luckily, I have time to watch screencasts from various conferences. Last few weeks I'm watching videos from <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/fronteers12">Fronteers2012</a>. They are all great and it worths checking out. However, there is something which I found really interesting. It's about animating pseudo elements.</p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>As you may know only Firefox supports chaining of pseudo classes and elements. For example this doesn't work everywhere.</p><pre>.box:hover:before {    font-size: 20px;}</pre><p>Why you ever need this? If it was supported by all the browser, the developers may use this for animating <a href="http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/CSS-before-and-after-pseudo-elements-in-practice">pseudo elements</a>. They are very often used for bullets or icons in front of elements in a list and it will be nice to add transitions there.</p><h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2><p>There is a of course a workaround. It involves the usage of <em>inherit</em> value. If you use it, you are basically saying <em>"get the value from my parent element"</em>. For example:</p><pre>&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.wrapper {    color: #0F0;}.p {    color: inherit;}</pre><p>The color of the text in the paragraph is the same as the one set to the wrapper. That's because we use <em>inherit</em> as a value. </p><p>Let's get a real use case. We have a div called <em>.box</em> and text inside it.</p><pre>&lt;div class="box"&gt;    I'm a box&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>With pure CSS we are making an icon in front of the text.</p><pre>.box:before {    display: block;    float: left;    width: 15px;    height: 15px;    content: "";    margin: 3px 12px 0 0;    background-image: url('...');}</pre><p>This looks great, but we want to animate the bullet. The image used as a background looks like that:</p><p><img alt="CSS: the power of inherit" src="http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/articles/CSSThePowerOfInherit/icon-bullet.jpg" /></p><p>I.e. to animate it we just need to change the <em>background-position</em> property and move the background a bit. However, because we can't use <em>.box:hover:before</em> we need to use another approach. On mouse over we could change values on the <em>.box</em> class. The pseudo element is actually a child of it, so if we use <em>inherit</em> we will have an access to the value which we need. Here is what I'm talking about:</p><pre>.box {    background-position: 0 0;}.box:before {    background-position: inherit;}.box:hover {    background-position: 15px 0;}</pre><p>The <em>background-position</em> property by default is set to <em>0px 0px</em>. If we hover the box it will become <em>15px 0px</em>. And because the pseudo element inherits this value it will have the same <em>15px 0px</em> applied. The box itself doesn't have background, which means that changing <em>backgroud-position</em> doesn't affect anything. Here is the solution in practice:</p><p>So, the idea is to find something which is not working for the container, but it is important for the pseudo element. For example, you may use <em>top</em> and <em>left</em> to move the icon. You know that these properties take affect only if you position the element absolutely or it is a fixed one. </p><pre>.box {}.box:before {    position: absolute;    top: inherit;    left: inherit;}.box:hover {    top: 20px;    left: 12px;}</pre><p><em>top</em> and <em>left</em> doesn't move the box, but they move the bullet.</p><h2 id="credits">Credits</h2><p>The credits of this smart solution goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/kizmarh">Roman Komarov</a>.
