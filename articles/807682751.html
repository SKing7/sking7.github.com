            <h1>Chrome Dev Summit 2014: The Applied Science of Runtime Performance</h1>
            <section class="content">
    <p>Late last year I built the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/">Chrome Dev Summit</a> site. I wanted it to have a <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/">Material Design</a> look and feel, since it’s a great design language, and I felt it would be a great fit for the kind of site I wanted to create. But, as with any new design language, there are questions, challenges, and decisions to take, and especially so when dealing with the conventions of the web.</p>

<p>One aspect of the site that was particularly challenging to create was the  “takeover” effect when you click on a card.</p>

</p>

<p>Getting an effect like this to run at 60fps took some thinking, prototyping, and a few interesting compromises. At Chrome Dev Summit, I spoke about this effect and explained in gory detail how I went about building it.</p>



<h1 id="building-a-high-performance-animation">Building a high performance animation</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/">High performance animations</a>, today at least, are those that favor the browser’s compositor. If you’re able to stick to changing transform and opacity properties, typically you’ll see great performance. The general approach I took to the card animation does just that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Measure the position of all the elements in the card when the card is collapsed.</li>
  <li>Toggle the card’s classes to expand it (without animating).</li>
  <li>Remeasure the position of the elements in the card now the card is expanded.</li>
  <li>Calculate the differences.</li>
  <li>Apply negative transforms to move the elements back to the start positions.</li>
  <li>Switch on animations.</li>
  <li>Remove the negative transforms and watch the elements whizz out to their final locations on screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this might sound expensive, but there is a window of 100ms from the moment a user interacts before the animation must start. Any more than this and the user will perceive a delay. You can use this time to do expensive preparatory work so that you can run more cheaply during the animation itself. There is also a window at the end of about 50-100ms to do tidy up work, which may be handy depending on what you’re trying to do.</p>

</p>

<p>The expensive work to do the animation is done inside that first 100ms and, on a Nexus 5 the work takes something in the region of 70ms, so there’s room to spare.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in looking at the site in more detail you’ll be pleased to hear that <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devsummit">the code has been released on GitHub</a>, so go and take a look!</p>
