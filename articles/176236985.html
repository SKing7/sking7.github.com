<h1>Using Jekyll with Pages · GitHub Help</h1>
<div><p>In addition to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing">supporting regular HTML content</a>, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/">some other advanced templating features</a>.</p><h2>
<a name="using-jekyll" href="#using-jekyll"><span></span></a>Using Jekyll</h2><p>Every GitHub Page is run through Jekyll when you push content to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages#setting-the-domain-in-your-repo">a specially named branch</a> within your repository. Because a normal HTML site is also a valid Jekyll site, you don't have to do anything special to keep your standard HTML files unchanged. Jekyll has thorough documentation that covers its features and usage. Simply start committing Jekyll formatted files, and you'll be using Jekyll in no time.</p><h2>
<a name="installing-jekyll" href="#installing-jekyll"><span></span></a>Installing Jekyll</h2><p>Although it's technically not necessary to use GitHub Pages, if you run into trouble, such as your site not building as expected, it's highly recommended that you install Jekyll on your computer to preview your site before publishing or to help diagnose troubled builds.</p><p>Luckily, installing Jekyll on your computer, and ensuring your computer most closely matches the GitHub Pages settings is easy thanks to <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem">the GitHub Pages Gem</a>. To install Jekyll, you'll need a few things:</p><ol>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></strong> - Jekyll requires the ruby language. If you've got a Mac, you've most likely already got Ruby. If you open up the terminal application, and run the command <code>ruby --version</code> you can confirm this. Your Ruby version should begin with <code>1.9.3</code> or '2.0.0'. If you've got that, you're all set. Skip to step #2. Otherwise, follow <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">these instructions</a> to install Ruby.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a></strong> - Bundler is a package manager that makes versioning Ruby software like Jekyll a heck of a lot easier and is highly recommended if you're going to be building GitHub Pages sites locally. If you don't already have Bunder installed, you can install it by running the command <code>gem install bundler</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></strong> - The main event. You'll want to create a file in your site's repository called <code>Gemfile</code> and add the line <code>gem 'github-pages'</code>. After that, simply run the command, <code>bundle install</code> and you're good to go. If you decided to skip step #2, you can still install Jekyll with the command <code>gem install github-pages</code>, but you may run into trouble down the line. Here’s an example of a <code>Gemfile</code> you can use (placed in the root directory of your repository):</p></li>
</ol><pre lang="rb"><code>source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
</code></pre><h2>
<a name="running-jekyll" href="#running-jekyll"><span></span></a>Running Jekyll</h2><p>The best way to run Jekyll, and to ensure your computer matches the GitHub Pages build server is to run Jekyll with Bundler. Use the command <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>, and your site should be available at <code>http://localhost:4000</code>. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/">the Jekyll documentation</a>.</p><h2>
<a name="keeping-jekyll-up-to-date" href="#keeping-jekyll-up-to-date"><span></span></a>Keeping Jekyll up to date</h2><p>Jekyll's an <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">active open source project</a>, and is updated frequently. As the GitHub Pages server is updated, the software on your computer may become out of date, resulting in your site appearing differently locally than it does when published. To keep Jekyll up to date, you can occasionally run the command <code>bundle update</code> (or if you sadly opted out of step 2, via <code>gem update github-pages</code>).</p><h2>
<a name="configuring-jekyll" href="#configuring-jekyll"><span></span></a>Configuring Jekyll</h2><p>You can configure <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#configuring-jekyll">most Jekyll settings</a> by creating a <code>_config.yml</code> file.  The only options we override are as follows:</p><pre lang="yml"><code>safe: true
lsi: false
pygments: true
source: your top-level directory
</code></pre><p>Keep in mind that if you change the <code>source</code> setting, your pages may not build correctly. GitHub Pages only considers source files in the top-level directory of a repository.</p><h4>
<a name="troubleshooting" href="#troubleshooting"><span></span></a>Troubleshooting</h4><p>If your Jekyll site is not rendering properly after you push it to GitHub, it's useful to run Jekyll locally so you can see any parsing errors. In order to do this, you'll want to use <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/blob/master/github-pages.gemspec#L16">the same versions of Jekyll and other dependencies that we use</a>.</p><p>To ensure your local development environment is using the same version of Jekyll and its dependencies as GitHub Pages, once Jekyll is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#installing-jekyll">installed</a>, you can periodically run the command <code>gem update github-pages</code> (or <code>bundle update github-pages</code> if using Bundler). For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem">GitHub Pages Gem repository</a>.</p><p>If your page isn't building after you push to GitHub see the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/pages-don-t-build-unable-to-run-jekyll">Pages don't build</a> guide.</p><div><p>If you are having issues with your GitHub Jekyll pages, make sure you are not using categories that are named the same as another project, it could cause path conflicts. For example, if you have a blog post named 'resume' in your user repository and a project named 'resume' with a pages branch, they will overwrite each other.</p></div><h4>
<a name="turning-jekyll-off" href="#turning-jekyll-off"><span></span></a>Turning Jekyll off</h4><p>You can completely opt-out of Jekyll processing by creating a file named <code>.nojekyll</code> in the root of your pages repository and pushing that to GitHub. This should only be necessary if your site uses directories that begin with an underscore, as Jekyll sees these as special directories and does not copy them to the final destination.</p><h3>
<a name="contributing" href="#contributing"><span></span></a>Contributing</h3><p>If there's a feature you wish that Jekyll had, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">fork it</a> and send a pull request. We're happy to accept user contributions.</p></div></div>
