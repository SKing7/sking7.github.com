</span><p>If you’ve been following closely, you’ve seen us play&nbsp;with extending the Viget color palette to a full spectrum of <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/add-colors-to-your-palette-with-color-mixing">colors</a> and <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/shades-of-gray-yes-really">grays</a>.</p><span>
													</span><span>

</span><p>Now that we have a whole rainbow it makes referencing difficult beyond hex values. In other words, the colors need an equivalent for casual conversation — something with soul.</p><span>

</span><h3>Options</h3><span>

</span><p>I’ve been playing around with a few different methods. While I haven't found a perfect solution, there are some options:</p><span>

</span><ul>
	<li><strong>Use a tool -&nbsp;</strong>There are tools available like <a href="http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#0B7199">Name That Color</a> and <a href="http://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/">Color Name &amp; Hue</a> (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/chuckborowicz/status/463303455122391040">@chuckborowicz</a>) that provide approximate names based on hex values. These are great; but, the names can be too esoteric for everyday use.</li>
	<li><strong>Compare to a list -&nbsp;</strong>Compare colors to lists like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">Named Web Colors</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors">Crayola</a>, or <a href="http://ingridsnotes.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/the-color-thesaurus/">Ingrid's Color Thesaurus</a> and look for similarity.</li>
	<li><strong>Make it up -&nbsp;</strong>Just wing it. There are no rules. Name the colors however you like. Try an image search based on a term to see what colors emerge. Ask a friend for a second opinion. Everyone has an opinion about colors.</li>
	<li><strong>All of the above -&nbsp;</strong>Go crazy. Do all the things.</li>
</ul><span>

</span><p><strong>I usually go with "All of the Above."</strong>&nbsp;I use the tools for discovery and ideas —&nbsp;sometimes I reference lists —&nbsp;then I pick the best fit, or add my own. <em>Yes</em>, it can be time-consuming. <em>No</em>, it does not have any real meaning as far as the HTML and CSS are concerned. <em>Yes</em>, there are official <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">named web colors</a> (but, they’re limited and don’t always fit). <em>No</em>, there’s no real system to the process — but I think it still works.</p><span>

</span><h3>Bonus</h3><span>

</span><p>For added bonus, try to choose your color names according to a theme. Ideas include&nbsp;nature, gemstones, jellybean flavors, celebrities, Disney characters, and so on. Two amazing examples&nbsp;of sticking to a theme are&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wearedorothy.com/shop/the-colour-of-song-open-edition">Colour of Song</a> and <a href="http://www.wearedorothy.com/shop/the-colour-of-popular-music-open-edition">Colour of Popular Music</a>&nbsp;posters by <a href="http://www.wearedorothy.com/">Dorothy</a>.</p><span>

</span><p>For this, I chose color names that are also names of people.&nbsp;<em>Fun fact:</em>&nbsp;Ten of these names (Skye, Kelly, April, Coral, Rowan, Ruby, Asher, Heather, Pearl, and Lilia) are names (or family names) of Viget staff past and present.</p><span>

</span><p>Here’s what the Viget color names look like:&nbsp;</p><span>

</span><p>Naming colors is even more important when it comes to grays since there is no hue differentiation:</p><span>

</span><p>Now that our expanded colors have more colorful names, they have more character and individuality. They’re alive, they have soul, and I can easily reference each color’s&nbsp;name with its own accompanying hex value.&nbsp;Both humans and machines win. Let’s dance!</p><span>
